===========

Welcome to [leycec](https://github.com/leycec)'s `vimrc`. [Herein lie buried many
things which if read with patience may show the strange meaning of](http://genius.com/Web-du-bois-the-souls-of-black-folk-the-forethought-annotated) maintaining
well-structured and -commented Vim dotfiles.

## Motivation

Dotfiles are intended to be rapaciously picked apart. Ours are scant exception.
Snippets galore, we say! To better glorify the inscrutable art of working Vim
snippetry, *every* block of *every* VimL in *every* dotfile in this repository
has been scrupulously structured, commented, and contemplated. (Usually at the
most neckbeardly hour of the night.)

Dotfiles matter. Let's get to it.

## Installation

Our dotfiles are ideally installed with [`vcsh`](https://github.com/RichiH/vcsh).

**To be written.**

## Caveats

You probably don't want to fork our dotfiles. They're not quite there, people. If
you currently lack Vim dotfiles of your own, consider instead forking (in no
meaningful order):

* [amix](https://github.com/amix)'s [vimrc](https://github.com/amix/vimrc). It's
  **ultimate**.
* [nvie](https://github.com/nvie)'s [vimrc](https://github.com/nvie/vimrc). It's
  lots of love.

## License

Our dotfiles are currently licensed under the [University of Illinois/NCSA Open
Source
License](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Illinois/NCSA_Open_Source_License),
a hospitably permissive license for the whole Vim family. See
[LICENSE](https://github.com/leycec/vimrc/blob/github/LICENSE) for grim details.
