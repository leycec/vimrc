# --------------------( SYNOPSIS                           )--------------------
# Blacklist all files and subdirectories of the current directory matching the
# following git-specific glob expressions.

# For further details, see:
#
# * "man gitignore" for high-level commentary.
# * "man 7 glob" for low-level commentary on glob syntax. Note, in particular,
#   that glob() and hence ".gitignore" files support only a proper subset of
#   bash- and zsh-style glob syntax.

# Ignore NeoBundle's top-level directory. Since some bundles have non-trivial
# installations forking external commands (e.g., "make"), copying bundle
# subdirectories into this directory does *NOT* generally suffice to install
# bundles. Since all missing bundles will be implicitly reinstalled on the next
# Vim startup from the configuration defined in the top-level "conf.d"
# directory, there exists no demonstrable reason to commit bundles to git.

# Unfortunately, symbolic links are static and hence have no means of
# dynamically resolving to the current user's home directory.
